# Bounded Context

TODO: add description of the concept and its usage in Spine

As DDD book advises:
```
“Explicitly define the context within which a model applies. Explicitly set boundaries in terms of team organization, usage
within specific parts of the application, and physical manifestations such as code bases and database schemas.
Keep the model strictly consistent within these bounds, but don’t be distracted or confused by issues outside.”

```
