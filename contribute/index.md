### Documentation Conventions

#### Use syntax highlighting
Code examples should be given with syntax highlighting. To highlight blocks of code properly, use three back-ticks and corresponding language name.
For example:
<pre>```java
    // Some java code here.
```</pre>

<pre>```protobuf
    // Some protobuf code here.
```</pre>
 
#### Mark TODOs as code
If you leave a TODO comment in text, frame it as a code:

```
   `TODO: add link here.`
```
It would appear in the text like this: `TODO: add link here.`

#### File and Folder name
While adding new chapters or single articles, please use hyphens in the corresponding folders’ and files’ names with two and more words.

Please also rename the “README.md” file inside the folders to “index.md”.
