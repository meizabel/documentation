# Spine Event Engine Concepts

<p class="lead"> This chapter introduces some key architecture concepts we use in Spine Event Engine.</p> It assumes that you've read the [Introduction](README.md). 
The Diagram below represents an architecture of the application built with Spine Event Engine.

Spine provides realization for most important building blocks of the CQRS oriented application.

##Write side
**Command** is an instruction to do something. Commands are messages that instruct a specific entity to perform a certain action.They are named with a verb in the imperative mood plus and may include the aggregate type. Unlike an event, a command is not a statement of fact; it's only a request, and thus may be refused. (A typical way to convey refusal is to throw an exception).In Spine [command](/java) is defined as a protobuf message. 

**Event** is something that happened in the past.
Capture all changes to an application state as a sequence of events. In Spine events are defined as protobuf messages. Find out more about [Writing an Event] .

**Aggregate** handles commands, applies events, and have a state model encapsulated within it that allows it to implement the required command validation, thus upholding the invariants (business rules) of the aggregate.
Read more on declaring an [Aggregate](/java/aggregate.md) in Spine.

**Aggregate Repository** manages Aggregates, sends events to Event Bus and latest Aggregate States to the Aggregate Stand.

**Command Bus**

**Command Handler** receives and validates commands, executes the required actions, and dispatches events describing any state changes to the system.

**Command Store** 



** Process Manager** â€” is a piece of code that coordinates and routes messages between bounded contexts and aggregates. You may find a broader explanation of this term  in [CQRS Journey](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj591569.aspx) book. A process manager gives a single place where the routing is defined.

**Process Manager Repository** manages communications between Command Bus and Process Manager. It also processes events from the Event Bus.


**Event Bus** allows publish-subscribe-style communication between components without requiring the components to explicitly register with one another (and thus be aware of each other).

** Event Handler**

  **Event Store. ** Events generated by the Aggregates as a result of commands that change state are written to an Event store. Event Store communicates with Stream Projection Repository by sending WHAT? events.
  
  ## Read Side
  ** Aggregate Stand ** provides service similar to what Stream Projections does, the Aggregate Stand would return complete instances of aggregate states, or their projections upon queries from users.

**Stream Projection.** Objects that subscribe to a stream of events in the system, and provide a view of these to the application. Stream Projection Repository manages Projections.



**Query Service**. Aggregate Stand Service and Stream Projection Repositories are linked to the Query service, and the Query Service would read data from them, then passing it to the client.
