# Spine Event Engine Concepts

<p class="lead"> This chapter introduces some key Spine architecture concepts.</p> It assumes that you've read the [Introduction](README.md). For language-specific details, see the [Getting Started](/Getting Started/README.md).
The Diagram below represents architecture of the application build using Spine.

Spine provides realization for most important building blocks of the CQRS oriented application.


**Command** is an instruction to do something. Commands are messages that instruct a specific entity to perform a certain action.They are named with a verb in the imperative mood plus and may include the aggregate type. Unlike an event, a command is not a statement of fact; it's only a request, and thus may be refused. (A typical way to convey refusal is to throw an exception).In Spine [command](/java) is defined as a protobuf message. 

**Event** is something that happened in the past.
Capture all changes to an application state as a sequence of events. In Spine events are defined as protobuf messages. Find out more about [Writing an Event] .

**Aggregate** handles commands, applies events, and have a state model encapsulated within it that allows it to implement the required command validation, thus upholding the invariants (business rules) of the aggregate.
Read more on declaring an [Aggregate](/java/aggregate.md) in Spine.

**Aggregate Repository** manages Aggregates, sends events to Event Bus and latest Aggregate States to the Aggregate Stand.

**Command Bus**

**Command Handler** receives and validates commands, executes the required actions, and dispatches events describing any state changes to the system.

**Command Store**


**Event Bus**

**Process Manager**

**Process Manager Repository** manages Process Manager ???


  **Event Store **. Events generated by the Aggregates as a result of commands that change state are written to an event store

**Stream Projection**  

** Aggregate Stand ** provides service similar to what Stream Projections does, the Stand would return complete instances of aggregate states, or their projections upon queries from users.

Aggregate Stand Service and Stream Projection Repositories are linked to the Query service, and the Query Service would read data from them, then passing it to the client.
