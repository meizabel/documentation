This chapter introduces some key architecture concepts Spine is based on. It assumes that you reviewed the [Introduction](README.md).
Below you can find a typical Spine Event Engine application architecture employed within the Bounded Context.

Spine provides realization for most important building blocks of the CQRS Event Sourced application. In terminology we heavily lean on Domain-Driven Design (DDD) [“Big Blue Book”](http://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215) by Eric Evans, [“CQRS Jorney”](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj554200.aspx) by Microsoft, as well as [“Enterprise Integration Patterns”](http://www.amazon.com/o/asin/0321200683/ref=nosim/enterpriseint-20) by Kyle Brown and Bobby Woolf. 

## 

## Domain Model Concepts

**Command** are messages that instruct a specific entity to perform a certain action. Unlike an event, a command is not a statement of fact; it is only a request, and thus may be refused. A typical way to convey refusal is to throw an exception. In Spine [command](/java/commands.md) is defined as a protobuf message.

**Event** is something that happened in the past.
All changes to an application state are captured as a sequence of events. Events is the main “database” of the application. In Spine [events](/java/event.md) are defined as protobuf messages as well.

**Error** — `TODO: define`

**Failure** — `TODO: define`

**Command Handler** is an object, which receives commands, modifies the state of the application, and generates events if the modification was successful. `TODO: links?`

**Aggregate** is the main building block of a business model. [Aggregates](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Aggregate) is the most common case of Command Handler. They guarantee consistency of data modifications in response to commands they receive. In response to a command an aggregate modifies its state and produces one or more events. In Spine [aggregates are defined as Java classes](/java/aggregate.md).

** Event Handler** is an object that is subscribed to receive events.

** Process Manager** `TODO: new description needed.`. A process manager can be both Command Handler and Event Handler.

**Projection** is Event Handler, which transforms the event stream of application data into some structural representation. Projections are main building blocks of Query side of the application. `TODO: links.` 


## Architectural Concepts

**Bounded Context** — `TODO: define. Mention multiple contexts and how they interact.`

**Repository** is a mechanism for encapsulating storage, retrieval, and search behavior which emulates a collection of objects. It isolates domain objects from details of the database access code. *Aggregate Repository*, *Process Manager Repository*, and *Projection Repository* are types of the repositories your application would have.

**Command Bus** is responsible for routing the command to its handler. Unlike a Command Handler it does not change business model or produce events.

**Event Bus** allows publish-subscribe-style communication between components without requiring the components to explicitly register with one another (and thus be aware of each other).

**Command Store** receives commands from the Command Bus and records command statuses received from Aggregate Repository and Command Handler.

<a name = "eventstore"></a>
**Event Store. ** Events generated by the Aggregates as a result of commands that change state are written to an Event store. Event Store also sends events in response to the Projection Repository requests.

  ** Aggregate Stand ** is called that way to emphasize its _“read”_ nature. It provides service similar to what Stream Projection does, the Aggregate Stand would return complete instances of aggregate states, or their projections upon queries from users.

**Query Service**. Aggregate Stand Service and Stream Projection Repositories are linked to the Query service, and the Query Service would read data from them, then passing it to the client.
