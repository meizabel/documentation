This chapter introduces some key architecture concepts Spine is based on. It assumes that you reviewed the [Introduction](README.md).
Below you can find a typical Spine Event Engine application architecture employed within the Bounded Context.

Spine provides realization for most important building blocks of the CQRS Event Sourced application. In terminology we heavily lean on Domain-Driven Design (DDD) [“Big Blue Book”](http://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215) by Eric Evans, [“CQRS Jorney”](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj554200.aspx) by Microsoft, as well as [“Enterprise Integration Patterns”](http://www.amazon.com/o/asin/0321200683/ref=nosim/enterpriseint-20) by Kyle Brown and Bobby Woolf. 

## 

**Command** are messages that instruct a specific entity to perform a certain action. Unlike an event, a command is not a statement of fact; it is only a request, and thus may be refused. A typical way to convey refusal is to throw an exception. In Spine [command](/java/commands.md) is defined as a protobuf message.

**Command Bus** is responsible for routing the command to its handler. Unlike a Command Handler it does not change business model or produce events.

**Command Handler** receives and validates commands, executes the required actions.
Command Handler changes the state of the business model and produces corresponding events, which are then written to the [Event Store](#eventstore). It also writes status to Command Store.

**Event** is something that happened in the past.
All changes to an application state are captured as a sequence of events. In Spine [events](/java/event.md) are defined as protobuf messages as well.

**Aggregate** is technically a "concept" and not a file, a class, or a thing you can readily point to in an IDE. It is a logical collection of domain objects, that should form an atomic and cohesive whole. Find more detailed overview of the Aggregate and its definition in Spine in the [article](/java/aggregate.md).

** Process Manager** coordinates and routes messages between bounded contexts and aggregates. You may find a broader explanation of this term  in [CQRS Journey](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj591569.aspx) book. A process manager gives a single place where the routing is defined.

**Repository** is a mechanism for encapsulating storage, retrieval, and search behavior which emulates a collection of objects. It isolates domain objects from details of the database access code. 

So Aggregate Repository, Process Manager Repository and Projection Repository are examples of the  Repository type. 

**Command Store** receives commands from the Command Bus and records command statuses received from Aggregate Repository and Command Handler.

**Event Bus** allows publish-subscribe-style communication between components without requiring the components to explicitly register with one another (and thus be aware of each other).

** Event Handler** is an object that is subscribed to receive events from Event Bus.

<a name = "eventstore"></a>
**Event Store. ** Events generated by the Aggregates as a result of commands that change state are written to an Event store. Event Store also sends events in response to the Projection Repository requests.

  ** Aggregate Stand ** is called that way to emphasize its _“read”_ nature. It provides service similar to what Stream Projection does, the Aggregate Stand would return complete instances of aggregate states, or their projections upon queries from users.

**Query Service**. Aggregate Stand Service and Stream Projection Repositories are linked to the Query service, and the Query Service would read data from them, then passing it to the client.
