# Welcome to Spine Event Engine

Spine Event Engine is a multi-language, open-source framework.
It helps developers to build Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) and Event Sourcing (ES) applications. 

Spine aims to free up developers from creating boilerplate code as much as possible.


### Why Spine?
TBD

It is built on top of [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/overview) (a.k.a. protobuf) and [gRPS](http://www.grpc.io/docs/) to bring easiness and efficiency into development of the applications with a microservice-oriented architecture. All this allows you to focus on your business logic, instead of the plumbing.


The Framework provides implementations of the most important CQRS/ES building blocks. 
You can find out more about key architecture concepts [here](concepts.md).
 
While working on Spine we absorbed great industry [experience](prior_art.md) and were inspired by many modern works in this field.

### Get Started

At the moment Spine supports application with backend part written on Java and any UI realization. 
Spine allows building client applications on Java, JavaScript, Android and iOS (Swift.
