# Welcome to Spine Event Engine

Spine Event Engine is a multi-language, open-source, event sourcing framework.
It helps developers to build Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) and Event Sourcing applications. 

Spine aims to free up developers from creating boilerplate code as much as possible.


### Why Spine?
Spine champions the idea of code generation. 
It is built on top of [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/overview) and [GRPS](http://www.grpc.io/docs/) to bring easiness and efficiency into development of the applications with a microservice-oriented architecture. All this allows you to focus on your business logic, instead of the plumbing.


The Framework provides implementations of the most important CQRS/ES building blocks.
