# Welcome to Spine Event Engine

Spine Event Engine is a multi-language, open-source, event sourcing framework.

Spine helps developers to build Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) and Event Sourcing applications. 


### Why Spine?
Spine is built on top of [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/overview) and [GRPS](http://www.grpc.io/docs/) to bring easiness and efficiency into development of the applications with a microservice-oriented architecture. All this allows you to focus on your business logic, instead of the plumbing.



The Framework provides implementations of the most important CQRS/ES building blocks.
