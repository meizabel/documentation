# Welcome to Spine Event Engine

Spine Event Engine is a multi-language framework for building Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) and Event Sourcing (ES) applications.

Spine aims to free up developers from creating boilerplate code as much as possible. Our framework is built on top of [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/overview) (a.k.a. protobuf) and [gRPC](http://www.grpc.io/docs/) to bring easiness and efficiency into development of applications with a microservice-oriented architecture. You can focus on business logic, instead of the plumbing.

### Why Spine?

*  **Domain model language is Ubiquitous** not only in people communications, but **in computer communications too**. The model is defined once in protobuf, most of the  implementation code is automatically generated.
*  **The domain model is strongly typed** and open for evolution. Unlike some of  CQRS/ES frameworks that treat commands and events as Json objects, Spine promotes strong typing of all parts of a business model.
*  Choice of Storage and Deployment Platform
*  Open Source

Spine allows building applications with Java backend and any UI framework, as well as building client applications on Java, JavaScript, Android and iOS (Swift).
