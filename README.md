Spine aims to free up developers from creating boilerplate code as much as possible.


### Why Spine?
TBD

It is built on top of [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/overview) (a.k.a. protobuf) and [gRPS](http://www.grpc.io/docs/) to bring easiness and efficiency into development of the applications with a microservice-oriented architecture. All this allows you to focus on your business logic, instead of the plumbing.


The Framework provides implementations of the most important CQRS/ES building blocks. 
You can find out more about Spine key concepts [here](concepts.md).
 
While working on Spine we absorbed great industry [experience](prior_art.md) and inspired by many modern works in this field.
