# Welcome to Spine Event Engine

Spine Event Engine is a multi-language framework for building [Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html) and [Event Sourcing (ES)]( applications.

Spine aims to free up developers from creating boilerplate code as much as possible.


### Why Spine?

*  Ultimately Ubiquitous 
*  Domain Model in a Message
*  Choice of Storage
*  Choice of Deployment Platform
*  Open Source

Spine allows building applications with Java backend and any UI framework, as well as building client applications on Java, JavaScript, Android and iOS (Swift).

It is built on top of [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/overview) (a.k.a. protobuf) and [gRPC](http://www.grpc.io/docs/) to bring easiness and efficiency into development of the applications with a microservice-oriented architecture. All this allows you to focus on your business logic, instead of the plumbing.
