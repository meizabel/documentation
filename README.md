# Welcome to Spine Event Engine

Spine Event Engine is a multi-language, open-source, event sourcing framework.



## What is Spine Event Engine

Spine Event Engine is the framework that helps developers to build Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) and Event Sourcing applications. 

Spine is built on top of [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/overview) and [GRPS](http://www.grpc.io/docs/) to bring easiness and efficiency into development of the applications with a microservice-oriented architecture. All this allows you to focus on your business logic, instead of the plumbing.



The Framework provides implementations of the most important building blocks, such as aggregates, repositories, command dispatchers, event buses and stream projections.
