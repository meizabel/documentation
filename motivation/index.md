# Motivation

We started working on Spine after two CQRS/ES projects. Having the experience
of:
- tons of manual work for creating commands, events, etc.
- delivering events and data to web and mobile clients.


...


We decided to create a framework that can help us and development groups like us to build CQRS/ES apps easier.
There are 
*  [Protocol Buffers](motivation/working-with-protocol-buffers.md).
* Events and Commands are [ strongly typed](motivation/strongly-typed.md).
* Ubiquitous language is [ubiquitous](/motivation/ubiquitous-language.md) across human communications and computing devices interactions.
* [Bounded Context](/motivation/bounded-context.md) is important.
* [Immutability](/motivation/immutability.md)
