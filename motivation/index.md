# Motivation

We started working on Spine after two CQRS/ES projects. Having the experience
of:
- tons of manual work for creating commands, events, etc.
- delivering events and data to web and mobile clients.

Being a team that strives for efficiency in each project we are working on, implementing a great deal of cutting edge technologies to make development process easier and more productive, we could not just accept it. 
Instead, we decided to create a framework that can help us and development groups like us to build CQRS/ES apps easier.

There are four fundamental principles Spine is based on:
*  [Protocol Buffers](motivation/working-with-protocol-buffers.md).
* Events and Commands are [ strongly typed](motivation/strongly-typed.md).
* Ubiquitous language is [ubiquitous](/motivation/ubiquitous-language.md) across human communications and computing devices interactions.
* [Bounded Context](/motivation/bounded-context.md) is important.
* [Immutability](/motivation/immutability.md)
